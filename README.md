This application is an app where users can access books from the googlebook api. Read books, save books and rate books. This app is built using the 
jetpack compose library, I also used Retrofit as client http protocol. I utilized also Dagger Hilt dependency injection. I used firebase to authenticate 
and log in users to the firebase and firestore db system. I used lifecycle methods using coroutines to handle asynchronous calls. The application followed
the MVVM architectural design pattern. Among other technologies used.
